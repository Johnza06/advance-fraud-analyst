# Prompt Templates

This directory contains system and user prompt templates used by the fraud detection agent.

* `system_prompt_v1.txt` encourages concise answers.
* `system_prompt_v2.txt` asks for step-by-step reasoning for deeper analysis.
* `user_prompt_template.txt` provides a template for inserting transaction details.

The A/B variants in the system prompts allow experimentation with answer verbosity and reasoning depth.
